# Pose tracking

[[PoseProcessor]] estimates 33 2D and 3D pose keypoints, it locates
the person / pose region-of-interest (ROI) and predicts the pose
keypoints providing smooth, stable and accurate pose estimation.
2D pixel pose keypoints - points in the screen coordinate space.
X and Y coordinates are normalized screen coordinates (scaled by
width and height of the input image), while the Z coordinate is
depth within orthographic projection space, it has the same scale
as X coordinate (normalized by image width) and 0 is at the center
of hips. These points can be used for 2D pose overlays or when
using orthographic projection. Estimation of Z coordinate is not
very accurate and we recommend to use only XY for 2D effects.
3D metric points - points within 3D space of perspective camera
located at the space origin and pointed in the negative direction
of the Z-axis. These points can be used for 3D avatar overlays or
virtual try-on. Rigged and skinned models can be rendered on top
of the pose aligning skeleton/armature joints with 3D keypoints.
3D and 2D points are perfectly aligned, projections of 3D points
coincide with 2D pixel coordinates within the perspective camera.

[[PoseProcessor]] emits [[PoseResult]] structures containing results
of pose tracking that are passed to your [[Renderer]]. [[PoseEngine]]
is a straightforward specialization of [[Engine]] for [[PoseProcessor]].

Simple application utilizing PoseProcessor. In this application we
add runtime switching between front and rear cameras. Note how we
disable the button to prevent concurrent pipeline state change.

```typescript
import { PoseEngine } from "@geenee/bodyprocessors";
import { CustomRenderer } from "./customrenderer";
import "./index.css";

let rear = false;
const engine = new PoseEngine();
const token = location.hostname === "localhost" ?
    "localhost_sdk_token" : "prod.url_sdk_token";

async function main() {
    const container = document.getElementById("root");
    if (!container)
        return;
    const renderer = new CustomRenderer(
        container, "crop", !rear, "model.glb");

    const cameraSwitch = document.getElementById(
        "camera-switch") as HTMLButtonElement | null;
    if (cameraSwitch) {
        cameraSwitch.onclick = async () => {
            cameraSwitch.disabled = true;
            rear = !rear;
            await engine.setup({ size: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }, rear });
            await engine.start();
            renderer.setMirror(!rear);
            cameraSwitch.disabled = false;
        }
    }

    await Promise.all([
        engine.addRenderer(renderer),
        engine.init({ token: token })]);
    await engine.setup({ size: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }, rear });
    await engine.start();
}
main();
```

# Face tracking

[[FaceProcessor]] estimates 3D face landmarks, it detects and
tracks face mesh providing smooth, stable and accurate results.
Processor evaluates 2D pixel and 3D metric points as well as face
pose (translation+rotation+scale) aligning reference face model.
2D pixel face landmarks - points in the screen coordinate space.
X and Y coordinates are normalized screen coordinates (scaled by
width and height of the input image), while the Z coordinate is
depth within orthographic projection space. These points can be
used for 2D face filters or when using orthographic projection.
3D metric points - points within 3D space of perspective camera
located at the space origin and pointed in the negative direction
of the Z-axis. These points can be used to apply texture face mask.
3D and 2D points are perfectly aligned, projections of 3D points
coincide with 2D pixel coordinates within the perspective camera.
Face pose - transformation matrix (translation+rotation+scale)
aligning reference face 3D model with the measured 3D face mesh.
Applying this transformation one can align 3D object with the
detected face. If the model's initial position is aligned with
the reference face, relative transformation will be preserved.

[[FaceProcessor]] emits [[FaceResult]] structures containing results
of face tracking that are passed to your [[Renderer]]. When you create
and setup application [[Engine]] for PoseProcessor, you need to provide
[[FaceParams]] to enable or disable particular result of face tracking.
Disabling unused estimations can improve application performance.
[[FaceEngine]] is a specialization of [[Engine]] for [[FaceProcessor]].

Simple application utilizing FaceProcessor. In this application we
use Snapshot helper to take a picture on click event. Additionally
we will add occluder using a plugin.

```typescript
import { FaceEngine } from "@geenee/bodyprocessors";
import { Snapshoter } from "@geenee/armature";
import { CustomRenderer } from "./customrenderer";
import "./index.css";

const engine = new FaceEngine();
const token = location.hostname === "localhost" ?
    "localhost_sdk_token" : "prod.url_sdk_token";

async function main() {
    const container = document.getElementById("root");
    if (!container)
        return;
    const renderer = new CustomRenderer(container);

    const snapshoter = new Snapshoter(renderer);
    container.onclick = async () => {
        const image = await snapshoter.snapshot();
        if (!image)
            return;
        const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
        const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
        if (!context)
            return;
        canvas.width = image.width;
        canvas.height = image.height;
        context.putImageData(image, 0, 0);
        const url = canvas.toDataURL();
        const link = document.createElement("a");
        link.hidden = true;
        link.href = url;
        link.download = "capture.png";
        link.click();
        link.remove();
        URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
    }

    await Promise.all([
        engine.addRenderer(renderer),
        engine.init({ token: token, transform: true })]);
    await engine.setup({ size: { width: 1920, height: 1080 });
    await engine.start();
    document.getElementById("dots")?.remove();
}
main();
```
